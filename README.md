## 🎮 Mini Game: Random Number Guess

As a fun extra, I included a simple **number guessing game** built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. It lets you:

- Pick a number between 1 and 10
- Get feedback if it's too high or too low
- Celebrate when you guess correctly
- Play again with a fresh number

You’ll find it embedded directly on the portfolio — try giving it a shot!
